# Parallel: Your Parking Meter Assistant


## What is Parallel?
Parallel is a Django and React-native application to help users in Lincoln, NE find information regarding Park and Go parking meters. The Django backend serves location information in a REST API that the React-Native frontend app consumes to display to users. In the app, users can filter for handicap meters, view parking meter hours of operation, see angle vs parallel spots, and get directions to a specific meter. 

To see a demo of the project and see how to run it with Expo, see the video "app-demo-video.MP4" in this repository. 

## Running Parallel

The frontend can be run via Expo on any device, and from /frontend/parallel run the command ```expo start```. The backend can be started by installing requirements from "requirements.txt" and running ```python manage.py runserver``` from the project directory.
